gmm: adbis gmm
gmm_int: gmm interpolating train and test sets
similarity_mb=orig_k=K_f=5: the K most similar datasets based on the 5 most relevant features extracted from RF importances, regarding the original metabase
similarity_mb=int_k=K_f=5: the K most similar datasets based on the 5 most relevant features extracted from RF importances, regarding the interpolated metabase
ifms*: interpolation from the most (weighted) similar, i.e. meta-targets from the most similar dataset are used as "predictions". Obs: k=30 only; no training/testing phase, interpolation curves only
clustering: clustering raw meta-features, eps between [4, 6]
clustering_inter: clustering raw meta-features, eps between [4, 6], k_searchin=30 only
